## Activity

## Part 1 - Fork & Clone the project

* Begin by _forking_ this project into a personal repository.
  * To do this, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of this page.
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Clone the repository from **your account** into the directory on your computer that you use to keep your projects (ex. `dev` directory).
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (ex. Visual Studio Code).

### Part 2 - Edit the _cloned_ project

* from a text editor (i.e. - Visual Studio Code), select:
  * `File` > `Add Folder to WorkSpace`
  * Select the directory you use to store your projects (ex. `dev` directory)
  * From the text editor,in the directory you use to store your projects (ex. `dev` directory), locate the newly cloned project
  * Expand the project from the _project explorer (may just be called `explorer`)_
  * Modify the `index.html` and `style.css` per the directions provided.

1. Open in browser/live server so you can see your changes

3. Add a universal selector at the top of the CSS file (`*`), and within that ruleset -- add a property of `box-sizing` with a value of `border-box`

4. Let's change the font on the page to be more modern. Go to the Google Fonts website and find the `'Open Sans'` font. Select all of the styles, and then paste the stylesheet link in the html, above the local CSS file.

5. In the body selector rule, add a font-family property with a value of `'Open Sans', sans-serif`

6. Let's change the background of the body. Replace the background-color property with the `background-image property`. Add a value of `linear gradient` with `whitesmoke` as the first value, and `rgb(35, 47, 58)` as the second value.

7. Convert `padding` property on `li a` rule to shorthand

8. Add a `text-align` property with a value of `center` to the same `li a` ruleset.

  - Add a `background-color` of `rgb(95, 211, 249)`

13. Add an `aside p` element selector directly underneath the `aside` selector, above the `#concert-schedule-sec`:

  - Add a `font-weight` property with a value of `600`
  - and a `font-size` property with a value of `1.25em`
  - Add a `background-color` property, with a value of `rgb(191, 133, 25)`
  - Add a `color` property, with a value of `whitesmoke`
  - Add a `padding` property, with a value of `0.75em` on all sides
  - Add a `margin` property, with a value of `0`

  - Add a `font-size` property with a value of `0.9em`
  - Add a `margin` of `1em` on all sides
  - Add a `padding` property of `0` on the top and bottom, `0.75em` on the right, and `1em` on the left

16. Add a `figcaption` element selector ruleset directly underneath the `figure` selector.

17. In the figcaption ruleset:

  - Add a property-value pair that will `make the text italic`
  - Add a `background color` property and set the value to `rgba(35, 47, 58)`
  - Set the `color` of the figcaption text to `whitesmoke`
  - Using the `padding shorthand` property, add `0.25em` of padding on all sides
  - Add an `opacity` property, and set the value to `0.5`
  - Add a `font-size` property, and set the value to 0.85em;

18. Around line 55, locate the `#about-sec` selector, directly below that, and above the `#about-sec div` selector, add an `#about-sec h2` ruleset:

    * Save all staged changes to local repository
  * `git push -u origin main`
    * Push changes from local repository to remote repository
